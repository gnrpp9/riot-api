Following up on the previous exemple
implemented more jquery/javascript to cycle through the match data

i was prevented from making too many request through the riot api by looping through the match data so i limited it to 7
(can only have 10 request per second)

pushing data into matchWinEnemyNeutralMonsterKills and matchLossEnemyNeutralMonsterKills arrays produced wierd 2d arrays in lines 78 and 85 respectively

while totalWinEnemyMonsterKills and numOfWins incremented correctly they won't show when displayed outside of the loop.
  the variables are lines 79 and 80 and displaying them was in lines 91-95 (i tried several ways to get the numbers to show)

I got to dig more into the match data in the jason files. I just can't find a way to diplay meaningfull data

good references!

api.jquery.com - on left click on ajax and scroll down to get jquery get calls

https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods - references to urls to get data from!
